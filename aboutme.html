    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I got into web designing back in the late 90's.  I found it interesting.  I started out using HTML all the time to do it.
    Then when software like Frontpage came out, I switched to that.  Over the years I have lost most of my HTML programming skills.
    I finally decided it was time to get back into it and learn how to do it the right way.  This led me to Full Sail University.
    I still am having trouble grasping the concepts, but I know as I practice I will get better.
    I am really enjoying the experience I am getting also.  I have learned some really great things.</p>
    <p>Thank you,</p>
    <p>Russell Chatham Jr.</p>
