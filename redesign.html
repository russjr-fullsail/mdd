        I chose to redesign the layout for the Jeep Club I am in.  Our current site lacked the functions to work successfully as a mobile website.

        <h4 class="media-heading">Home Page</h4>
        <p>Here is the new home page layout.  I took the navigation that was at the top that was very hard to use with a mobile media device and moved it to the left.
        Users are always complaining how hard it is to click on the links at the top of the page to chose the link.  Also the home page was very cluttered when using a mobile device.
        I removed the recent post section along with the shout out box that was put on there.</p>

    <div class="media-body">
        <h4 class="media-heading">Forum Board</h4>
        <p>Here is the new forum page layout.  I kept the navigation and links on the left.  I also got rid of the clutter on the left so the titles for each board is larger and easier to read.
        I got rid of the fancy boxes that slow down loading of the site on a mobile device.</p>

    <div class="media-body">
        <h4 class="media-heading">Board</h4>
        <p>Here is the new board page layout.  For this page I followed the same layout as the forum board page.  I wanted it to be easier to read.  I also wanted to keep the important stuff like when the post was made and how many views and replies were made to it.  I also wanted the information for who posted it.
        Everything is spread out now and easier on the eyes.</p>
